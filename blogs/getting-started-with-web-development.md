# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development has evolved significantly over the past decade. In this post, we'll explore the foundational skills and technologies needed to become a successful web developer in today's landscape.

## The Three Core Technologies

Every web developer should start with a solid understanding of:

1. **HTML** - The structure of web content
2. **CSS** - The presentation and styling
3. **JavaScript** - The functionality and interactivity

### HTML: The Building Blocks

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic structure of sites. It's what you use to put content on a page and give it structure, like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS: Making It Look Good

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. With CSS, you can control:

- Colors and typography
- Layout and positioning
- Responsive design
- Animations and transitions

### JavaScript: Adding Interactivity

JavaScript allows you to create dynamic content and handle complex interactions. It's what makes modern web applications possible.

## Modern Web Development

Today's web development ecosystem includes:

- **Frameworks** like React, Vue, and Angular
- **CSS preprocessors** like Sass and Less
- **Build tools** like Webpack and Vite
- **Version control** with Git

## Getting Started

If you're new to web development, here are some steps to begin your journey:

1. Learn HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript
2. Build simple static websites to practice
3. Explore modern tools and frameworks
4. Create a portfolio of projects
5. Never stop learning and experimenting

Web development is a field that rewards curiosity and continuous learning. The technologies may change, but the fundamental skills of problem-solving and user-focused design will always be valuable.
